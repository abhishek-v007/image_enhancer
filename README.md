I've created a comprehensive photo enhancement tool for you! This tool can help restore and improve old photographs like the one you shared. Here's what it can do:
Key Features:

Drag & drop or browse to upload your photo
Multiple enhancement controls including brightness, contrast, saturation, exposure, shadows, highlights, warmth, and sharpness
Preset filters like "Vintage Restore" which is perfect for old photos like yours
Real-time preview so you can see changes immediately
Side-by-side comparison of original vs enhanced
Download capability to save your enhanced photo


Note: The tool works entirely in your browser, so your photos stay private and aren't uploaded anywhere.
